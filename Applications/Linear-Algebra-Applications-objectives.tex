\begin{enumerate}

\item Construct visualizations of matrices related to vector fields. Explain how eigenvalues and eigenvectors relate to vector fields.
\item Explain how to generalize the derivative to a matrix. Use this
  generalization to locate optimal values of a function using the second derivative test. Explain the role of eigenvalues and eigenvectors in the second derivative test.
\item Describe a Markov process. Explain what a steady-state solution is and how it relates to eigenvectors of the transition matrix.
\item Find the currents in an electrical system involving batteries and resistors, using both Gaussian elimination and Cramer's rule.
\item Find interpolating polynomials. Generalize this curve-fitting process to solve the least squares regression problem of fitting a line to a set of data.
\item Find bases for the column space, row space, and null space of a matrix and its transpose by row reducing $A$ and $A^T$. Use these bases to find the coordinates of vectors relative to the bases.
