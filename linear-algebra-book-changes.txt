In the applications unit:
	Change the order to be 
		Derivatives
		Vector fields (they are derivatives)
		Special Kinds of vector fields - represented by matrices
		The second derivative test (they can tell me why flow outwards means positive eigenvalues, means concave up).
		Then move Markov Processes
		Then hit Kirchoff's laws, fitting data points, and regression
		End with Vector space vocabulary and why regression works.
		
I think this method will help students see the beauty and power of vectors much more.  It will help economists see why they need vector fields.  It will show how the second derivative test is used and why it is used.  If students had taylor series, I could even show them why it works (or include it inside an appendix).

Also, somewhere block matrices ought to be addressed.  Probably in the
first section when we talk about computation.

Somewhere there should a comparison of the sizes of linearly
independent and spanning sets.  For now, I put a few statements in
chapter 5 about this, but it would be good to see it earlier.
