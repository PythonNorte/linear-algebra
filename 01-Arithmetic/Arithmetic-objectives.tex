
\begin{enumerate}

\item Be able to use and understand matrix and vector notation, addition, scalar multiplication, the dot product, matrix multiplication, and matrix transposition. 
\item Use Gaussian elimination to solve systems of linear equations and write the solution in parametric and vector form. Define and use the words homogeneous, nonhomogeneous, row echelon form, and reduced row echelon form. 
\item Find the rank of a matrix. Determine if a collection of vectors is linearly independent. If linearly dependent, be able to write vectors as linear combinations of the preceding vectors.
\item For square matrices, compute determinants, inverses, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors. 
\item Illustrate with examples how a nonzero determinant is equivalent to having independent columns, an inverse, and nonzero eigenvalues. Similarly, a zero determinant is equivalent to having dependent columns, no inverse, and a zero eigenvalue.
